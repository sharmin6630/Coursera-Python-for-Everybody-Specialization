## **Page Rank** ##
First you will spider 100 pages from http://python-data.dr-chuck.net/ run the page rank algorithm and take some screen shots. Then you will reset the spider process and spider 100 pages from any other site on the Internet, run the page rank algorithm, and take some screen shots.

Don't take off points for little mistakes. If they seem to have done the assignment give them full credit. Feel free to make suggestions if there are small mistakes. Please keep your comments positive and useful. The course staff will assign the last 30% of the grade and it may take a few days to get graded.
